# OPSDatabaseGV
This will be an open source database of Violence in Guatemala country (OPSDGV)

So, to locate where are the violence or a murder, deaths, etc we need to create the locations, In other words we need a database of latitude and longitude where the places are like: the country, departments, regions, all those stuff that will determine the exactly location where were events.
